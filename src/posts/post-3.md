# Context
Recently, I restarted my learning journey with React, but I’ve reached a point where I can’t seem to move forward. There are so many limitless topics to research that I don’t even know where to look, read, or watch. Maybe it’s because I’ve started to forget the fundamentals of JavaScript. I watched some tutorials a long time ago, but now I realize I can’t remember most of the concepts and functions of JavaScript. So, what should I do?

Even when trying to continue my article on **Starkit-React**, I struggle to process new topics to add. I feel like I don’t have a solid foundation or a clear procedure. At this point, it feels like I’ve reached the end of my journey. But still, I’m going to keep trying—to continue the process and learn something, whatever it may be. I don’t care how hard it is. I’ll trust the process, stay focused, and keep moving forward.
